# Shipping_Service
**Welcome to my _Shipping Service_!**

Installation is very simple:

<p>Given Docker is installed on your machine, <br/>
at the project root directory, enter the following command: <br/>
- docker-compose up <br/> <br/>

and Voila! Images are being created and then cotainers will start.

Go to localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and start testing!

Thank you.
